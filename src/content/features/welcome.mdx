As part of the KITeGG research project funded by the BMBF and the respective states of the participating universities, the AI+D Lab opens it's doors at the University of Design Schwäbisch Gmünd.

<p>
  The AI+D Lab is the place at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd for research and teaching
  that combines artificial intelligence and design. In the form of generated
  images and videos, intelligent sensor systems and language-based interfaces,
  Machine Learning will be increasingly used in design practice. We will explore
  the possibilities and challenges of artificial intelligence in design: How can
  AI technologies be integrated into the design process and how does this change
  the work of designers? What role can designers play in the (co-)design of
  AI-based applications and how do they need to be prepared for this in their
  education and how can we design desirable futures with AI technologies?
  <p>
    <p>
      In order to be able to use AI technologies in the design process, it is
      important to build up sound knowledge about the possibilities and
      limitations of this technology. As a physical location, the lab is the
      first point of contact for students and teachers and provides the
      technical infrastructure for projects and experiments with different AI
      models and technologies.

### The KITeGG Project

The research project consists of five universities with art and design departments, of which each contribute different perspectives on the intersection of art, design and technology. Besides the HfG in Schwäbisch Gmünd, the University of Applied Sciences in Mainz, the University of Art and Design in Offenbach am Main, the Cologne International School of Design and the University of Applied Sciences Trier are part of the consortium.

The project was initiated with the goal of researching the new possibilities emerging from the latest developments within AI and Machine Learning research. Besides applied research, the
