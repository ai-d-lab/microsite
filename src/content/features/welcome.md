The AI+D Lab at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd is a research group that explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and design. The group comprises a team of researchers, designers, and developers who are passionate about exploring the potential of AI in the field of design.

Their work is a part of the KITeGG project, which is aimed at making AI tangible and comprehensible by connecting technology and society through design. The project is a joint effort by five universities and is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the State of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The AI+D Lab's primary goal is to develop tools and methods that enable designers to incorporate AI into their design processes. Their research is focused on creating a toolkit that allows designers to create AI-based generative design projects. These projects can help designers generate a range of design options that they can then explore and refine.

The lab is also working on a set of methods that enable designers to integrate AI into their design process. These methods involve identifying and defining design problems that can be addressed using AI. The lab team then works to create a set of AI models that can help solve these problems. By integrating AI into the design process, designers can generate innovative solutions that would not be possible using traditional design methods.

The AI+D Lab's work has far-reaching implications for the field of design. By incorporating AI into the design process, designers can generate new and innovative solutions to complex design problems. These solutions are not limited by human creativity and can help designers create more effective, efficient, and sustainable designs.

In conclusion, the AI+D Lab at HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd is a dedicated team of researchers, designers, and developers who are working to explore the potential of AI in the field of design. Their work is a part of the larger KITeGG project, which aims to make AI tangible and comprehensible by connecting technology and society through design. Through their research, the lab is developing a set of tools and methods that enable designers to incorporate AI into their design process, resulting in more effective, efficient, and sustainable designs.
