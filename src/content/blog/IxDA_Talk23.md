Interaction design is a field that continually evolves alongside technological advancements, facing ever new possibilities and challenges. The same applies to interaction design education, which must adapt to meet the changing demands of the discipline. Especially the emergence of AI-based learning systems that change their behavior over time and with use pose new questions for the discipline.
At the [IxDA interaction design education summit 2023](https://www.edusummit.ixda.org/) we had the opportunity to discuss this exciting topic with other educators, learners and practitioners. With our talk titled "Pathways for integrating AI education in the design curriculum" we contributed our experiences and thoughts on AI education in design from the KITeGG project and the establishment of the AI+D Lab at HfG Schw채bisch Gm체nd.

We also compiled our experiences and thoughts into a comprehensive paper. For further information and access to the paper, please follow this [Link](https://ai-d-lab.github.io/blog/ai_is_not_a_wildcard/).

A big thanks to J체rgen Sp채th, Chair of Education Summit 23, for inviting us and to the entire organizing team for their wonderful support and event organization.
