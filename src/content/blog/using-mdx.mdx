This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.

### Custom Image component

import Image from "../../components/Image.astro";

<Image
  src="/1.jpg"
  caption="a cat with a hat"
  alt={undefined}
  className="half"
/>

### Custom Video component

import Video from "../../components/Video.astro";

#### Video from Youtube

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ygg0bXls8CA" />
#### Video from Vimeo
<Video src="https://vimeo.com/486087661" />
#### Default view if a video link could not be parsed
<Video src="https://www.unknown-platform.com/1234" />

- **Note:** [Client Directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives) are still required to create interactive components. Otherwise, all components in your MDX will render as static HTML (no JavaScript) by default.
