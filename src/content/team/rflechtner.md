Rahel’s professional fascination moves along the tension between the physical and digital worlds. As an industrial and interaction designer, she focuses on new concepts of human-machine collaboration, tangible interactions, and on co-creating assistive technologies. She has worked for different design studios and research institutions, such as Phoenix Design in Stuttgart, the Design Research Lab in Berlin, and the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). In October 2022, together with Aeneas Stankowski she joined the HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd as a guest professor for creative AI, building the new AI+D Lab, where they are researching how AI will impact human-computer interaction and design and how the technology can be implemented in design education.
