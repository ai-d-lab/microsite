      <h1>We are AI + D</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the lab website of AI + D, a research group at the HfG
        Schwäbisch Gmünd. We are a group of researchers, designers, and
        developers who are interested in the intersection of AI and design. We
        are currently working on a number of projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are part of <a href="https://gestaltung.ai/" target="_blank"
          >KITeGG</a
        > - Making AI tangible and comprehensible: Connecting technology and society
        through design. A joint project of five universities to integrate AI in design
        theory. Funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and
        the State of Rhineland-Palatinate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to develop a set of tools and methods that enable designers
        to incorporate AI into their design process. We are currently working on
        a toolkit that allows designers to create AI-based generative design
        projects. We are also working on a set of methods that allow designers
        to incorporate AI into their design process.
