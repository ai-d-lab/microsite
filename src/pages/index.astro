  <h1 class="font-bold">We are AI + D</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the lab website of AI + D, a research group at the HfG Schwäbisch
    Gmünd. We are a group of researchers, designers, and developers who are
    interested in the intersection of AI and design. We are currently working on
    a number of projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are part of <a href="https://gestaltung.ai/" target="_blank">KITeGG</a> -
    Making AI tangible and comprehensible: Connecting technology and society through
    design. A joint project of five universities to integrate AI in design theory.
    Funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the State
    of Rhineland-Palatinate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our goal is to develop a set of tools and methods that enable designers to
    incorporate AI into their design process. We are currently working on a
    toolkit that allows designers to create AI-based generative design projects.
    We are also working on a set of methods that allow designers to incorporate
    AI into their design process.
